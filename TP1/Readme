  Documentation
  -------------

  To use this program, run the file "prog" in a terminal.
  Type the numbers that you want to multiply.
  When you have finished to type your numbers, press CTRL+D to
  tell the program you have finished.
  
  Don't forget that if you multiply a number with 0, the result
  is always 0, so the program will stop immediately and print 0.
